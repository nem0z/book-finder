# book-finder

Describe the book you want in plain language and get recommendations grounded in real catalogue data.
The AI only ranks and explains books retrieved from our own database, so it can't invent titles or facts.

Status: proof of concept, in progress. See [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md) for the data model and indexes.

## Requirements

- Go 1.27+
- Postgres 17 with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) 0.8+ and [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (the provided `docker-compose.yml` runs both)

## Start Postgres

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Postgres 17 with pgvector on `localhost:5432` (user, password and database: `bookfinder`), with
settings tuned for bulk loading. Data is kept in the `pgdata` volume; `docker compose down -v` deletes it.

## Start the embedding model

Semantic search uses [EmbeddingGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/embeddinggemma), served by Ollama. The
same `docker compose up -d` starts Ollama on `localhost:11434`; download the model once (~620 MB):

```sh
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull embeddinggemma
```

## Create the schema

```sh
go run ./cmd/migrate
```

Migrations live in `internal/db/migrations` and are applied in file-name order, once each. Set `DATABASE_URL`
to use another database (default `postgres://bookfinder:bookfinder@localhost:5432/bookfinder?sslmode=disable`).

## Load the catalogue

Download the works, editions, authors, redirects and ratings dumps from
[openlibrary.org/developers/dumps](https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps) (about 17 GB in total; `data/` is
git-ignored), then:

```sh
go run ./cmd/ingest \
  -works data/ol_dump_works_2026-09-30.txt.gz \
  -editions data/ol_dump_editions_2026-09-30.txt.gz \
  -authors data/ol_dump_authors_2026-09-30.txt.gz \
  -redirects data/ol_dump_redirects_2026-09-30.txt.gz \
  -ratings data/ol_dump_ratings_2026-09-30.txt.gz
```

It applies the migrations, then rebuilds the catalogue from scratch: the existing `works`, `authors` and
`work_authors` rows are replaced. See [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md) for what is kept.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...
```

Database tests need a disposable database and must run one package at a time:

```sh
BOOKFINDER_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://bookfinder:bookfinder@localhost:5432/bookfinder?sslmode=disable go test -p 1 ./...
```

CI runs them against Postgres 17 + pgvector on every push.
